# Session tokens

When a user is authenticated in your application, a short-lived session token is generated by Clerk.js that depicts the fact and it's sent to your backend. Your backend will typically want to validate that the session token is valid (i.e. that it comes from Clerk, that it hasn't expired etc.)

## Default session claims

Below are the default session claims that Clerk generates for you:

* `azp`: authorized party - the url of the application that this token is authorized for.
* `exp`: expiration time - the time at which this token expires.
* `iat`: issued at - the time at which this token was issued.
* `iss`: issuer - the creator and signer of this token.
* `nbf`: not before - the time before which this token cannot be used.
* `sid`: session ID - the ID of the current session.
* `sub`: subject - the ID of the current user of the session.
* `orgs`: organizations - the organizations that the user belongs to.
* `org_id`: organization ID - the ID of the organization that the user belongs to.
* `org_slug`: organization slug - the slug of the organization that the user belongs to.
* `org_role`: organization role - the role of the user in the organization.
* `act`: actor - will include the ID of the impersonating user. See [user impersonation](/docs/custom-flows/user-impersonation#jwt-claims) for more information.

If you want to customize your session token, you can do that by following our guide on [customizing session tokens](/docs/backend-requests/making/custom-session-token).

## Validate session tokens

If you're using the middleware provided by our Clerk SDKs, this is all handled automatically in every request. If you're not using the middleware, you can still use the respective helpers provided by the SDKs to validate the tokens.

To learn how to manually verify a session token, please refer to the [manual JWT verification ](/docs/backend-requests/handling/manual-jwt) section of our documentation.
